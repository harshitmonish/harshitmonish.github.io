permalink: /publication/2019-12-15-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'In this paper, we compare the classification models of Data mining that can predict the fraudulent firm based on current and past risk factors. Further, we apply the ensemble techniques to improve the models and finally compare the models based on accuracy and compute complexity. The dataset collected is multivariate having 18 attributes that have been considered as risk factors.'
