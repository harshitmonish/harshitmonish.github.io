Hello, My name is Harshit Monish, I am a Graduate Student at University at Buffalo, SUNY majoring in Artificial Intelligence. A Data Science, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning enthusiast and a highly accomplished and results-driven technology leader, I am passionate about creating a positive impact through the development of new technology.

My current research interest lie in Applied Machine Learning, ML for System efficiency(hw-sw co-design), Language modeling, Deep Learning for Sports Analytics, ML training optimization techniques, ML techniques in Hardware Modelling.

Competencies
======
**THINGS I LOVE TO DO**

I started coding in 6th grade and absolutely love building software applications. As a Technology lead, I have a proven track record of defining novel product concepts and leading product development from concept to launch.

Engineering:
* Software Development and Machine Learning Systems with extensive coding experience in desktop technologies like Python, C++, Java, Tensorflow, Pytorch.

Leadership:
* Developer community leader, I lead with purpose and style that promotes excellence.

Volunteer Experience
======
 I strongly believe that **"Knowledge always increases with sharing it"**, hence I took the initiative to start the [Google Developer Student Club at University at Buffalo](https://gdsc.community.dev/university-at-buffalo/) and currently leading the developer community. The aim of the club is to help students bridge the gap between theory and practice and grow their knowledge in a peer-to-peer learning environment.

 From 0 to more than 200 student developers in the community, we are able to help them gain new skills through hands-on workshops, Information sessions, project building activities, etc. about a wide range of technical topics including- Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, Data Engineering, Android Development, etc. [GDSC-UB Info Sessions and Lab Workshops.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE81NjVFck4axGmgZpwG--Q)

My First True Love
=====
A passionate BasketBall player for the past 15+ years, I have played in several open-national and collegiate-national level tournaments and corporate tournaments as well. Amongst other things, Basketball has taught me a special way of life.
