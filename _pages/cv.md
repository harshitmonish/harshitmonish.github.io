Education
======
* Master's in Artificial Intelligence, University at Buffalo, SUNY (class of 2022)
* Fellowship (Machine Learning), Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India. (2018)
* Bachelor's in Computer Science, JIIT, Noida, India. (Class of 2015).
&nbsp;

Work experience
======
* Summer 2021: Intel Corporation
  * Software Engineer (Machine Learning) Intern 
    * QIRI Chatbot
    * Targetted testcases execution

* Fall 2021: University at Buffalo
  * Research Assistant
    * Implemented federated learning using convolution neural network in a cross-silo setting in a peer to peer architecture with Java PeerSim distributed network of nodes.

* May 2016 - July 2021: Cadence Design System
  * Reduced the time to reach the target code coverage by 40% by learning the optimal input conditions of the randomization engine which are required to achieve the target code coverage using the non-linear regression technique.
    * Code coverage is the first and crucial step in the validation cycle. The engineers previously wrote the input conditions manually, which was a tedious and time-consuming task and took days to achieve the coverage goal.
    * Deployed the model at the customer end which made randomized coverage regression faster by reducing the customerâ€™s coverage run from 17000 runs to 5000 runs to hit the target coverage.
  * Virtual Bridge Project:
    * Created view panels in system debugger using Java Swing framework which displays the protocol transaction packets information across the bridge, State transition information, and transaction statistics for performance analysis
    * Created an automated framework to fetch user application information and displayed it in debugger GUI Using GDB and Python
    * This helped 20+ existing customers to debug both hardware and software issues in-house and enabled the 100+ hardware and software engineers to debug the issue together.
  * IXCOM Compiler
    * Worked on supporting new language constructs of System Verilog HDL language both syntactically and semantically using LEX and YACC tools
    * Increased the performance of macro handling code by 20% and developed applications to support new macro syntax.
