permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'In this poster we put forward a job scheduling algorithm with the goal of the minimum completion time, maximum load balancing degree using an improved deferential algorithm in cloud computing. Our proposed solution is to use machine learning (ML) techniques, especially supervised learning techniques to learn and predict the compile time of a design at the parser stage of the palladium frontend compiler.'

In this poster we put forward a job scheduling algorithm with the goal of the minimum completion time, maximum load balancing degree using an improved deferential algorithm in cloud computing. Our proposed solution is to use machine learning (ML) techniques, especially supervised learning techniques to learn and predict the compile time of a design at the parser stage of the palladium frontend compiler.
